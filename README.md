# NUber

In this project, I created a clone of Uber's app using JavaScript, React, React Native, Redux.js, Google Autocomplete, various Google APIs, Tailwind CSS, Navigation and Expo's
Live Development Environment. I made this app with the intention of revamping Northwestern's SafeRide app, and sent the overhaul to the developers of NU SafeRide for 
their consideration! 

A description of NU SafeRide is seen below:

"Safe Ride Hours
Academic Year
Safe Ride is available from 7:00 pm to 3:00 am, seven days a week during the academic year when classes are in session.

Safe Ride reserves the right to reduce or suspend operations during inclement weather or during other circumstances that may place our drivers, and passengers at risk."

To build this, I was assisted by Sonny Sangha in his react-native livestreams. Cheers Sonny! 

Full functionality of the app can be seen below!
